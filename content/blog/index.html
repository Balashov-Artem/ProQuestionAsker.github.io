<p>You know when you’re working on a project and you run into a really specific problem that you think no one could have possibly solved? And then you find <strong>the most perfect post</strong> by some kind human being who documented their own solutions to issues?</p>
<p>Well, I hope that someday this will be the home to at least one post that makes someone’s day a little easier. I plan to fill it up with all of my solutions to problems I’ve run into on my R journeys.</p>
