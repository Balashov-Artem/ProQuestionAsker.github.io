```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
"print.magick-image" <- function(x, ...){
  ext <- ifelse(length(x), tolower(image_info(x[1])$format), "gif")
  tmp <- tempfile(fileext = paste0(".", ext))
  image_write(x, path = tmp)
  knitr::include_graphics(tmp)
}
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### TL;DR
I'm a marine biologist and science communicator by training, but I'm taking all of the data analysis, statistics, and mathematical modeling skills I've learned (and continue to learn) and I'm now applying them to new problems.

### The Long Version
I've always loved science, exploration, and discovery.  My natural curiosity, love of animals and the environment, and constant pursuit of knowledge led me into a marine biology and chemistry double major in college (BS/BA) and a Master's degree in Marine Sciences. That generally leads people to think that I was "playing with animals" all day. 

And while I *did* get to work with some amazing animals over the years...

```{r,  echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%"}
library(magick)
library(magrittr)


turtle <- image_read("images/turtle.jpg") %>% 
  image_scale("400") %>% 
  image_scale("x400") %>% 
  image_border("#f4f4f4", "20x20")

dolphin <- image_read("images/dolphin.jpg") %>% 
  image_scale("400") %>% 
  image_scale("x400") %>% 
  image_border("#f4f4f4", "10x20")

seal <- image_read("images/seal_1.jpg") %>% 
  image_scale("400") %>% 
  image_scale("x400") %>% 
  image_border("#f4f4f4", "20x20")

animals <- c(turtle, dolphin, seal)


all_animals <- image_append(animals)
image_write(all_animals, path = "images/all_animals.png",format = "png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/all_animals.png")

```

Only about **5 - 10%** of my time was spent working with animals. My professional experience (in time spent performing a single activity) breaks down like this:

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(highcharter)

highchart () %>% 
  hc_chart(type = "bar") %>% 
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Percentage of Time")) %>% 
  hc_plotOptions(bar = list(
    dataLabels = list(enabled = FALSE),
    stacking = "percent")) %>% 
      hc_add_series(name = "Animal Care", data = c(10)) %>% 
      hc_add_series(name = "Experimental Design", data = c(20)) %>% 
      hc_add_series(name = "Data Collection", data = c(30)) %>% 
      hc_add_series(name = "Data Analysis", data = c(40)) %>%
      hc_add_series(name = "Project Communication", data = c(20)) %>% 
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_darkunica())
  
```
